0) Software requirements: 
	i) Matlab
	ii) AMPL (required only for Figure6.m and Figure7.m)
	iii) IBM Ilog CPLEX (required only for Figure6.m and Figure7.m)

1) Run PreliminariesAndFigure5Noise.m to reproduce figure 5
2) Save output as LoblafromDataT100S7.mat
3) Specify AMPL (amplPath) and CPLEX (cplexPath) installation paths in Figure6.m, Figure7.m
4) Run Figure6.m, Figure7.m, Figure8.m to reproduce the corresponding figures

NOTE: Nothing else should be modified!
